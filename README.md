# finalfrtproject
This is my final Future Ready Talent project!
Nowadays it is really very hard to maintain your lifestyle by eating healthy food and also to prepare healthy diet conscious food at home.
When you are too busy working and have no time to look out for your diet.
I've built a food delivery service website that saves your time and offers a variety of diet conscious healthy food meals, which is delivered to your doorstep.
The Azure Service used to create the website is : Static Web Apps
Languages used to make the project : HTML, CSS, JavaScript
I used Visual Studio Code to write the code of the project.
